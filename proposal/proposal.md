## Abstract

The goal would be to mainly represent an underwater network of caves with procedurally generated textures for the walls, rocks, and so on. There would be algae generated with an l-system on the walls, swimming fishes controlled with boids and fog for an underwater feeling. On the surface, water would move with either random waves or wind waves. If we have time, we could fairly simply adapt this underwater world to create a surface with birds, trees and biomes.
This would create a whole underwater scene in which we could evolve and (if used in an other project or by someone else) put the basis for a game or even a virtual reality experience.
The biggest challenge is probably going to put all the methods together in a coherent and working program. Making sure fishes don't swim into walls, placing algae correctly, generating waves on the procedurally generated water, and so on. An other challenge is to allow the user to evolve naturally in the world while also providing him tools to play with some settings we give him (number of fishes, speed, size, fog density, algae parameters, ideally allowing to create waves manually, tweaking textures, and so on).
